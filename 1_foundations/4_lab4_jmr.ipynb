    "This code is in `app.py`\n",

    "We will deploy to HuggingFace Spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start: remember to update the files in the \"me\" directory - your LinkedIn profile and summary.txt - so that it talks about you! Also change `self.name = \"Ed Donner\"` in `app.py`..  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also check that there's no README file within the 1_foundations directory. If there is one, please delete it. The deploy process creates a new README file in this directory for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit https://huggingface.co and set up an account  \n",
    "2. From the Avatar menu on the top right, choose Access Tokens. Choose \"Create New Token\". Give it WRITE permissions - it needs to have WRITE permissions! Keep a record of your new key.  \n",
    "3. In the Terminal, run: `uv tool install 'huggingface_hub[cli]'` to install the HuggingFace tool, then `hf auth login` to login at the command line with your key. Afterwards, run `hf auth whoami` to check you're logged in  \n",
    "4. Take your new token and add it to your .env file: `HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx` for the future\n",
    "5. From the 1_foundations folder, enter: `uv run gradio deploy` \n",
    "6. Follow its instructions: name it \"career_conversation\", specify app.py, choose cpu-basic as the hardware, say Yes to needing to supply secrets, provide your openai api key, your pushover user and token, and say \"no\" to github actions.  \n",
